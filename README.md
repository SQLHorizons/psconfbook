Code from The PowerShell Conference Book
==========

This repository contains the code (the downloadable extras as mentioned in the book).

The PowerShell Conference Book is designed to be like a conference in a book where each chapter is written by a different author who is a subject matter expert on the topic covered in their chapter. Each chapter is also independent of the others so you can read one chapter, ten chapters, or all of them. You can start with the first chapter, the last one, or somewhere in-between and not miss out on anything related to that particular topic. This book is written for the intermediate to advanced audience. Prior experience with PowerShell is highly recommended.

All (100%) of the royalties from this book are donated to the OnRamp scholarship program.
