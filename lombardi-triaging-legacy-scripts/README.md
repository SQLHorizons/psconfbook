# Extras for Triaging Legacy Scripts

The folders in this directory represent the various stages of triaging a legacy script:

- The first folder contains the raw scripts which are triaged over the course of the chapter.
- The second folder includes the scripts after they have been read, understood, and inline comments have been added to make them easier to follow.
- The third folder includes the scripts after relevant reference documentation in the form of comment-based help has been added to them.
- The fourth folder includes the scripts with inline comments, reference documentation, and the project README.

Each folder is a snapshot in time of what you might have committed into source control if you were triaging these scripts in your environment.
It shows the iterative approach to triage, going from inline comments to reference documentation to narrative documentation for future users.
